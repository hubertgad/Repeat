# Closed questions database - ***Repeat***

## What?
This is my first published project in ASP.NET. This project is more academic than practical, real-world application.
**Repeat** allow to create tests containing multi-choice questions and share them for other users. An user can take a test and see the summary with test result afterwards.

## Why?
I study a lot and I am aware that repetition is very important part of learning process. Repeat is a tool to repeat. ðŸ™‚

## How?
Site is based on Razor Pages and uses MSSQL database.
I have used Entity Framework Core as an ORM system.
Application uses Dependency Injection design pattern.
